ex : if the user enter 7 ---> 7 in binary = 00000111 , so the output = 3 . 
#9 

code allow user to enter numer of more than one digit , then convert it to binary and print it .
if user enter 392 for ex. , then the TASM work with the number as 3 digits in 3 registers , not in the same register , this code convert the 392 to binary (3*100 + 9*10 + 2*1) -->  and store it in one register . 
after that the code print the number (392%10) then save reminder to print it , (39%10) then save reminder to print it, (9) print it . 
so the user enter 392 --> and the output is 392 ..
